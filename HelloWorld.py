# This is an introduction to how challenges on Edabit work.
# In the Code tab above you'll see a starter function that looks like this:

# def hello():
# All you have to do is type return "hello world" on the second line

#Notes:
# The returned string must be in all lowercase letters.

def hello():
    myWord = "hello world"
    return myWord

print(hello())
